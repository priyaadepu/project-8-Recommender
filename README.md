README - Shopping Recommender System

Project Overview
The Shopping Recommender System is designed to provide personalized product recommendations to customers based on their past purchase behavior and browsing history. The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to improve customer engagement, satisfaction, and retention.

Project Objectives
•	Recommend products to customers based on historical purchase data and browsing patterns.
•	Enhance customer experience by offering relevant product suggestions.
•	Utilize machine learning techniques for accurate recommendations.
•	Evaluate the recommender system using relevant performance metrics.

Installation Instructions
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
•	Python (>= 3.7)
•	Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
Libraries Required:
Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn surprise matplotlib seaborn nltk

Running the Code:
1.	Download the project files and dataset.
2.	Open the notebook (recommendation.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3.	Run each cell sequentially to execute the workflow.
4.	The final recommendations and performance evaluations will be displayed.
5.	Implementation Details
   
1. Data Collection:
The dataset includes customer purchase records, product categories, and user interactions.

2. Data Preprocessing:
•	Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect entries).
•	Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
•	Data transformation (scaling and encoding categorical variables).

3. Recommendation Techniques Implemented:
•	Collaborative Filtering: Uses matrix factorization (SVD) to recommend products based on user-product interactions.
•	Content-Based Filtering: Recommends products by analyzing similarities in product attributes.
•	Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.

4. Model Evaluation:
Metrics Used:
•	Precision, Recall, F1-score
•	Mean Average Precision (MAP)
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for rating predictions

Visualizations:
•	Recommendation comparison charts
•	Performance metrics visualized using bar plots

How to Use the System
1.	Input customer ID and product category to generate recommendations.
2.	The system returns top-N product recommendations based on user history and similarity scores.
3.	Review the recommendation comparison between different filtering techniques.
Example Output:
Customer ID	Recommended Products
1001	Product A, Product B, Product C
1002	Product X, Product Y, Product Z
  	
Deliverables
•	recommendation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.
•	report.pdf: Detailed explanation of the system, methodologies, and performance analysis.
•	README.docx: Instructions on how to install and use the project.

Future Enhancements
•	Deploying the model as a web application.
•	Integrating real-time user feedback for dynamic recommendations.
•	Implementing deep learning-based recommendation techniques.
